# Hello World

This is my home page! My name is Kyle Mendoza and I am a student at [Cal State Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/) and my major is kinesiology, but I minor in computer science.

### CPSC 120

* Lab 4
    The number guessing game from lab 4, part 2 was one of my favorite labs because it's the first lab that really felt as if the user had influence on the program. Working with "if, then" statements to create a game for the user was something I enjoyed since it feels like an rpg game. In retrospect, a function so simple is fascinating because a user's input can determine the outcome of the way the program is run.

* Lab 7
    Lab 7, part 2 was a lab I had a lot of trouble with, however it taught me a lot of skills in coding that would be utilized in later labs. Similar to a love-hate relationship, the lab taught me how to also play blackjack as well as being one of the labs to really practice constructors. Thanks to this lab, I will be able to understand the rules of blackjack whenever given the chance to play.

* Lab 12
    The final project, lab 12 part 1 is my favorite one of all the labs we have done. From the day I learned how to write code, it's been a big question to me how it's possible for code to articulate into something displayable such as colors and messages. It's fascinating to understand how color is displayed from code and now I won't stop thinking about it whenever I think about light displaying on my computer.
